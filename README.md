# Quasi-maximum-likelihood-estimation-QMLE-of-spatial-dynamic-panel-data
This package implements quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) of spatial dynamic panel data based on paper by Lee &amp; Yu (2001): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407616302147. Specifically, we implement the QMLE formulation in equation (7).
